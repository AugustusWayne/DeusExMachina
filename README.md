Features
EEG Data Input: Upload EEG data for real-time attention detection.
Attention Visualization: See the attention levels through progress bars and interactive UI components.
Tabs Interface: Navigate between multiple EEG readings or feature settings using tabbed navigation.
Buttons & Controls: Simple buttons for uploading, analyzing, and resetting data.
Progress Bars: Visualize attention levels dynamically with real-time updates.
Tech Stack
